# BREAST-CANCER-STATISTICS-WITH-PYTHON
This Project was created for a Python class. It takes a dataframe in a file and finds correlations between areas and visualizes them using Python. The file in question is a CSV file from kaggle. One file generates the charts and the other is a outline for the program.
